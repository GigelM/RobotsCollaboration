#pioneer3-dx simple robot simulation

Usage:
1. ./run_pioneer_simple_gazebo

Details:
  I'm a simple robot, in a simple world.
  If it fits, I sits.And do nothing else.
  
Serious details:
  This runfile contains a command that starts gazebo with the world chosen to be used in every project we simulate here, and a Pioneer3-DX robot model that has no sensors on it.
  This exists so we can have a roslaunch of a simple robot.
  RViz visualization is no use in this case.

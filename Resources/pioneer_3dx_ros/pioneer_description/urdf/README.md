# pioneer_3dx_description files.

BRO, I added the propper urdf model of the pioneer and kinect.there are 2 models of pioneer.
The reason I did not delete them is because i did not checked if i use some of the urdf file in other launchfiles than the mapping with kinect.
Further verification is needed.
THE "robot_base" folder is taken from "aramis_description" package. I placed it into my test_ws.

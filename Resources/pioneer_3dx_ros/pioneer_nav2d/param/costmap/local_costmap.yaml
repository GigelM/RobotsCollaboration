local_costmap:
    transform_tolerance: 0.15       # (default 0.2) Specifies the delay in transform (tf) data that is tolerable in seconds. This parameter serves as a safeguard to losing a link in the tf tree while still allowing an amount of latency the user is comfortable with to exist in the system. For example, a transform being 0.2 seconds out-of-date may be tolerable, but a transform being 8 seconds out of date is not. If the tf transform between the coordinate frames specified by the global_frame and robot_base_frame parameters is transform_tolerance seconds older than ros::Time::now(), then the navigation stack will stop the robot.
    update_frequency: 30.0          # (default 5.0) The frequency in Hz for the map to be updated.
    publish_frequency: 30.0         # (default 0.0)The frequency in Hz for the map to be publish display information.
    width: 4.0                      # The width of the map in meters.
    height: 4.0                     # The height of the map in meters.
    resolution: 0.05                # The resolution of the map in meters/cell.
    static_map: false
    rolling_window: true            # Whether or not to use a rolling window version of the costmap. If the static_map parameter is set to true, this parameter must be set to false.
    always_send_full_costmap: true  # If true the full costmap is published to "~<name>/costmap" every update. If false only the part of the costmap that has changed is published on the "~<name>/costmap_updates" topic.

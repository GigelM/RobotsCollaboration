global_costmap:
    update_frequency: 1.0         # (double, default 5.0) The frequency in Hz for the map to be updated. 
    publish_frequency: 0.5        # (double, default 0.0) The frequency in Hz for the map to be publish display information. 
    static_map: true
    transform_tolerance: 0.5      # (double, default 0.2) Specifies the delay in transform (tf) data that is tolerable in seconds. This parameter serves as a safeguard to losing a link in the tf tree while still allowing an amount of latency the user is comfortable with to exist in the system. For example, a transform being 0.2 seconds out-of-date may be tolerable, but a transform being 8 seconds out of date is not. If the tf transform between the coordinate frames specified by the global_frame and robot_base_frame parameters is transform_tolerance seconds older than ros::Time::now(), then the navigation stack will stop the robot.

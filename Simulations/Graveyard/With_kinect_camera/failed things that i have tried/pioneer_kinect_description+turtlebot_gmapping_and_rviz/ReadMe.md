#make kinect do slam try nr. 1

What is this and why does this exists:

  Tried to make an URDF description file that has pioneer base and kinect model.
Robot tf frames are not joined with the fixed frame,so gmapping won't work.Not my brightest ideea,but it was the first try.Look into the pioneer_base_fusioned_with_turtlebot_mapping for better results!

        Main packages called:

- pioneer_gazebo
- turtlebot_gazebo
- turtlebot_rviz_launchers
